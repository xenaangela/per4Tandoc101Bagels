                        <p>Founded in 2012 right off the scenic Pacific Coast Highway, 101 Bagels & Subs has grown into a cherished local spot in Oceanside, California, known for its fresh, made-to-order bagels, sandwiches, and coffee. What began as a small, family-owned shop with a simple mission — to serve high-quality, flavorful food with a smile — quickly became a go-to destination for breakfast and lunch for locals, surfers, and travelers alike. Over the years, we’ve honed every recipe, from our hand-rolled bagels baked fresh each morning to our hearty subs piled high with Boar’s Head meats, crisp produce, and house-made spreads. Beyond the food, we pride ourselves on creating a welcoming atmosphere where everyone feels at home, whether you’re grabbing a quick bite on the go or lingering over coffee with friends. Our dedication to freshness, quality ingredients, and genuine service has earned us a reputation as more than just a sandwich shop — it’s a place where the community comes together, memories are made, and every meal reflects the best of SoCal hospitality.</p>
